(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

The most vulgar thing I could ask you
is for the play-by-play of the last time
you got fucked
by an employer.

It's taboo to aspire to anything
other than a bohemian existence
but it's also taboo to act on it,
so waving your boss goodbye
is steamy, unprecedented, disgusting,
pathetic, joyous, sad but most of all,
enviable.

My question and your answer
let me live vicariously
inside your gross situation.
