(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Upon your return to the castle,
inside the same weather-worn walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;where you came of age,
little appears changed:
same dustry smell, same racks of goods,
still black from time and wear,
same stoic onlookers
surrounding the old patriarch.
He appears unaged, voice still weary,
demeanor still bitter, always hinting defeat,
yet, without a hint of formality,
he informs you of his next-of-kin,
and bids you adieu.
You have a brisk walkabout,
and upon your return, he has vanished.
Stuffy-nosed and newly-armed,
you wonder whether you will return
someday, whether you can bear
to see what changes become
now that the King's bequeathed his crown.
