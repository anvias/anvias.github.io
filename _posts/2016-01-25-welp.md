We were never anything
but now that you're his
or he's yours,
I'm less.

No obligation,
just trends,
patterns I discovered
between us,
trending downward.
Less isn't more
when it's not just quantity.

A slighted consumer?
A future-on-hold?
A toy slipped away,
revisited when nostalgic,
yet insufficient?
Was it good enough
back in the beginning
when there were secrets
for you to unfold?
