The conceit of the poem
I read while sitting on the train,
curled up, knees up, squished,
a voyage from Manhattan to elsewhere,
for the weekend, when your days
are yours to waste, and when
you're kept in limbo between two halves,
Monday and Friday, work sandwich,
planning to return at dusk,
was that time and space
go on forever, or at least
we have no evidence they'll call it quits.
