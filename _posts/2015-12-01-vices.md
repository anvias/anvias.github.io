(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

It's December and there's a March of people down the line, they wait, only two vices--time and money--separating eater brains from beans, tongues acclimated over long workdays, workmonths, workyears with 30 days vacation benefits, unheard of in today's job market, count your blessings.
HR told me the other day "no shirt, no shoes, no service" as if they could control when I produce my services.
The company suffers. It's December. Folks indulge, businessmen even, in luxuries like steamed milk, tipping for services, and outerwear.
