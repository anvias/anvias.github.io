Scaffolding is like gift wrap for a building,
but who's the present for?

The city, but who gets to unwrap it?
The owner, the union, they share their toy with the residents, the passive observers.

But what is a gift before it's unwrapped?
Potential energy,
metastable, between
beginning and end.

Reversing Entropy, the elements, with time and money and desire.
Who is most pleased?

[Surely] Not the birds.
