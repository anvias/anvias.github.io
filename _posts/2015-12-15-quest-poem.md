Settled at the encampment,
the mystic strummed a verse, 
chant of microtones and arcana.
A snake of chorus curled within
the smoke, describing a mountain
of riches and aether, inhabitants
ascetic and needy. An impulse
to uncover their secrets unfolded
within my adventurer brain.
The stars guided my footsteps.

Upon completing my ascent,
the Shar Pei Priests of Catalon
asked me, tails wagging,
to mummify ten dragoons
in exchange for a teardrop vial
whose label promised the bearer
ten feet of good fortune
and a couple experience points.

Knowledge of mummification
was known at the time
to exactly ten men, wrinkling
slowly beyond deserts and seas.
I trudged across sands
to the Pyramid of Attire.
Encrypted beneath was Vago
the Learne'd of Egora,
known fan of pig flesh
and yeast, I provided in excess.
In return, the explicit permission
to mirror his learne'd processes.

We toiled till dusk
on the seventeenth day.
I bid Attire farewell,
traversed the same sands,
and familiar ascent.
Grappling with technique,
Vago's teaching in mind,
I performed for these priests
the task they'd assigned.
