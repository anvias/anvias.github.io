(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Their pastrami was a distinctly low-class pastrami, a slimy bottom end of an already-pedestrian food. Reconstituted slices on stale bread. Yum. A Pile of pink flaps, no flaky blacks or translucent fat to be found, and it tasted like bologna but cost $13? Maybe the price was a gentile--or gentrifier--special. I didn't have the CHUTZPAH to ask.
