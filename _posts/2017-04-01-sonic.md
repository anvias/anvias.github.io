(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Every time I play Sonic, I feel blue because:

~ you know he's only going fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;to save the baby animals.

~ a hedgehog has no business
&nbsp;&nbsp;defending the world worder.

~ anthropomorphizing is killing.

~ I gaze longingly at the Sega
&nbsp;&nbsp;Genesis ocean, bathed by Dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come True on the FM chip, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize no oceanic expanse
&nbsp;&nbsp;will connect with me so
&nbsp;&nbsp;unless pixelated and rendered
&nbsp;&nbsp;in full 8 bit glory on a small
&nbsp;&nbsp;CRT screen a few feet from
&nbsp;&nbsp;my parents' vacation bed.

~ we will never face such creative
&nbsp;&nbsp;technological constraints again.

~ I lost a life or two.

~ Sonic is also blue.
