(transcribed from notebook)

FAT MARBLED THE HILLSIDE,
SWEEPS OF FLESH PULSING
WITH MICROBIAL ACTIVITY.
GNOMES SLIDE ALONG THE VEINS,
ARMS RAISED AND CERAMIC.

I SNIFFED FROM THE SAFETY OF MY COFFEE CUP.
SALTY YET FRESH.
THE SEA AND THE THRILL
OF THE HUNT.
THE SPOILS HIDING
AT THE CENTER OF CROP CIRCLES,
THE MARVEL OF AGRICULTURE
AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS,
SAFETY REGULATED WITHIN
VAST BUREAUCRACIES,
SLICES COMBINED,
WHOLE GREATER THAN THE SUM
WHOLE GRAIN GROWS IN THE SUN,
MY SANDWICH IS FROM ITALY, IN QUEENS.
