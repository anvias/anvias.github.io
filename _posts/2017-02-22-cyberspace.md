Zooming shots of silicon chips, insectoid, lazily spinning upon a platform. A man in cyan latex pulls a lever, and the chips disapppear. A cube's edges and vertices swoop in arcs along the screen. Smooth motion. Smoother than tennis or pong, lacking blur, each refresh pushing new data through the VGA output port, an update, a change to the monitor's display. A Yamaha-produced integrated circuit, their pride and joy, triggers PCM samples and oscillations. Electrical signals descend from pins, tracing a circuitous print atop a green wafer, pushing upon a magnet, electro-magnetic motion triggering vibration. A cone sucks and pushes, dispersing sound through air, bouncing and reflecting and absorbing, perceived by the button-pushing human, mechanisms opaque. It is instantaneous. He sits.
