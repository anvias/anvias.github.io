(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

White moth,
hiding inside the hanger tube,
nibbling on my white cloth
for a month.

Disintegrating my shirts
as you become sated.
A flick of your wings,
and my trousers become your lunch.

Always twittering,
getting away.
Maybe I'll catch you
another day.
