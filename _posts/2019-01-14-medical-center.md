I'm watching the medical imaging center.
For rent, with monstrous Greek columns
had the ancients lived through the 80s
and cut costs with ready-cut plaster
cylinders and cubic capital.
Like a glob of marshmallow
fluff inside this brick and glass
sandwich,
you tiny two story center.
Medical imaging, for rent for months.
Makes you wonder what'll come next.
