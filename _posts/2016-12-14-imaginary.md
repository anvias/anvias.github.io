Our past and future selves
are our imaginary friends
for whom we create and ruminate
and promise to please or forgive.

As we sit on our bedspreads,
patiently awaiting the end
of the agony of today,
we ask our kindly friends
"will you be there tomorrow?
What will you think of me then?"

And we spend our days waiting
for ourselves to reply
and gratify our half-hearted efforts,
but we know it's all imaginary.
