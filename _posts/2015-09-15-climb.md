(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

I want to climb on structures whose only purpose is to be climbed on. I want to conquer cubes. I want to storm spheres and lose my balance while defending the highest point from some other dumbass. I want to ascend a ladder and find my self atop an inverted pyramid from which I can gaze out over the prism garden and dream about agency aka what color I should paint my next purchase. I want children to aspire to play in my universe, and I want adults to dismiss it out of pride but later admit to their boyfriends/girlfriends/selves that they wanted to try it and maybe experience "fun" again on physical but less finesse [sic] or dangerous terms.
