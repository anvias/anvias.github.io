(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

It is hard to create
when it doesn't burn your insides
when you don't rise at two
filled with passion and eroticism
and plans to build the next
nuclear reactor in your geographic
region.

Is it not enough to feel,
suprrise when a neighbor's
light bursts awake, sadness,
horns honking (let them honk),
cubes made of rectangles, both
before and after the war, space-
age and also regressive.

What I'm trying to say is:
have small dreams or at
least break the big ones
because I'm an adult and
I know best. Later.
