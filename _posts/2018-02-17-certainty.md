I live a life of complete certainty,
no risks taken without odds
and plans A and B and C
and another extra plan for
results unforseen.

There's too much risk,
too much pain, too much
unknown. It looms over me
and my body quakes and
my skin grows bumps and
I'm befallen by illness as
the shadow draws nearer.

Will the sun rise again?
Is it a cloud or nightfall
or the final explosion
of that neverending bomb
pinned up above me?

Humans treating one another
like they might treat a machine.
Humans becoming machines.
Humans becoming owned
and operated by machines.
Humans becoming dominated
by beautiful, pulsing machines.
