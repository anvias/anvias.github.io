(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Cobwebs are grand achievements
like the Vatican and Jane Goes To College,
merely fallen on hard times.
The Arachnid Historical Society
wont let me open my closet
and there's an embargo on postcards
dating before 1966, when some
hippy chick burned her father's
precious world war two corresponence,
pin-ups and all, her poor
beautiful mother lives in the fireplace
now and forever. The true tragedy
was the trunk's disruption,
her fingers like 747s
crashing into the twin towers,
decades of progress
in one fell swoop.
The Society was established
to prevent further tragedies of
this nature, so I'm stuck
in the same pair of pants
I've worn for the last 4 days.
