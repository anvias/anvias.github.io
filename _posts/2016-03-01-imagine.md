IMAGINE if aliens found
the voyager Golden Record
in space
and when they play it
it skips
stuck on some phrase, like
"Strawberry F"
and they wonder,
stroking tentacles in thought,
whether this medium flaw
was Human Intent/
Does Earth music have the
Sophistication
to branch?
Does the mind of a Human
run in two streams? Or three?
What mechanism could handle
taking both forks in the road?

Or perhaps
they will have such mechanism,
and thinking we are alike,
they reply with their
finest Art.
A branching tree,
exponential story,
each fork leading to another,
beauty only emerging
when all are taken
at once.
They will visit,
expecting to think alike,
and discover
our one-track minds,
consciousness more a ball of yarn
than a stream.
They will leave.
