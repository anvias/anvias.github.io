When we grow old, there will be so many pictures
of our pure and smiling (or frowning) faces
that our children will wonder whether we ever found the time
to make friends or lovers or works of art
other than portraits of our graceful selves.

We'll tell our children "oh yes, we did those things"
and omit the time we spent swiping right
or the time we spent smashing Like
or the time we spent eyeing our own little numbers,
refreshing, wondering who will return the favor.

Back in my day, you ordered food online and it took
two and a half weeks to ship,
and it was freeze-dried ice cream that hurt your lips,
but at least it was fat-free.
