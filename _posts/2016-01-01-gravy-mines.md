IN THE GRAVY MINES OF 39
WE MINED FOR GRAVY TO PASS THE TIME

-----------

WE MINED, WE MINED FOR GRAVY BRINE
      UNTIL NIGHTTIME

DISCO FRIES
POTATO MASH
TURKEY SIDES
CORNED BEEF HASH

MINING FOR POCKETS
OF BROWN JUICY GOLD
STENTED IN VEINS OF AFT
IMAGINE THAT!

WHEN GRAVY FLOWED THE TIMES WERE GOOD
TILL THE DROUGHT OF 44
WHEN GRAVY FLOWED NO MORE
