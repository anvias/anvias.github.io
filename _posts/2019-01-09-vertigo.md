Oh, where is that old vertigo
that once did hold my heart so fierce?
A feeling that I could not pierce:
a fog enshrounding cupid's bow,
I wait for cleansing winds to blow
and clear the air. Such deep my care!
The scorching sun I could not bear!
And yet the pressure had to grow,
my vision thrust above the cloud
upon a firecracker's thrust.
Atop the thunder, crashing loud
I try to survey and adjust.
But now I think I see the sky,
and why look down when one can fly?
