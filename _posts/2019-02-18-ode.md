On Ted Kaczynski's wiki page
his former colleague said,
"he could've become senior,
what wasted potential, Ted."

But something didn't sit quite right
when I read his little quote.
See, here you have a gifted man
who wants to rock the boat,
and the greatest life potential
you can see behind his eyes
is a bureaucrat professorship---
"oh, through the ranks he'd rise"?!

I encounter more resistance
as I try to justify
that man's greatest endeavor
is the drive to find out "why?"
Perhaps Montana Ted Kaczynski,
out standing in the glade,
was only trying to get us apes
to drop the whole charade.
