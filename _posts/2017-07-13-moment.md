(transcribed from notebook)

As that moment of weightlessness fades,
already forgotten,
and you begin descending those familiar tracks,
that familiar nausea in your belly,
you can't help but wonder why
your forehead is so tense, in pain?

You sustained no jarring impacts,
beyond the regular rumbling along the tracks,
and encountered no exceptional brightness.
Things are much the same as they were
before your same old nothing flew by.

And now as another end draws near,
you wonder if the cars will ever stop honking,
or if the illuminated sign will ever go dark.
Whether your roommate's footsteps will rouse you
while your body makes its futile gasp
toward peace.

Anyway, you strap back in
for your next go-around.
Maybe this time you'll remember to breathe.
