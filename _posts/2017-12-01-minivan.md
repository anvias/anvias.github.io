(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

The minivan embodies a multigenerational sexuality.
No ther object is so shared
for private, essential purposes
as the movement of life
in daylight,
or movement of exploration, at night.
The tension at minivan cohabitation
springs from the furious competition.
As with Oedipus, parties vie
to control its motion,
to direct its path,
to assert ownership upon the symbol.
But, unlike the tale,
the law and the force is on
the more established side,
and the parent cannot help but
dominate. For the family is not
a unit so much as an assertion
from old to young,
that something of value is here
and you better carry it forward.
