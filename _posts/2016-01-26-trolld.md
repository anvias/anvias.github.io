~How can Anything be real if our Eyes aren't real?~
I'm being goaded. I let fly:
I'm real because of experimentation in front of a mirror, also I look good.

~That's the big mistake (goaded again?),
nothing beautiful is Life.~
I can't handle his shit so I toss my platitude from Sunday school,
where I'd perform rebellious acts
like laughing during black & white movies
because I knew God wasn't Scientific:
Life Is Inherently Beautiful
Can't Argue With The Classics
Ham Lived 900 Years
But Under My Watch You Won't Live 90
