(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Rebellious nose,
o censor of smell!
Asymmetries granted unfairly,
spirit flowing into the right
and pouring out the left.
How you disrupt my gift of nothing!
What good is pain
if not to share!
Hangs heavy in the midnight air...
Heart pumping,
exotic mercury upon the tongue,
tossing, turning,
a blue glow, the nega-sun
illuminates the expanse
of emptiness
that we all made up
together.
Good morning and good night.
