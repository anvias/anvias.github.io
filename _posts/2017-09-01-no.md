(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

no No No NO NO!
A life unfulfilled
lived in agony!
The fundamental boredom--
day by day! Night by soulless night!
Tucked into bed like an ostrich!
Who will bring me to light?
Who will recognize my death?
Who will, at my request
bear witness, accept my birthright?
Who will see me to my tombstone?
Who will dig my grave?
Who could be so brave
to care for this unknown?
O half-hearted life!
O misery and strife!
