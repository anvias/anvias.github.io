(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Oh savage snake plant!
Erect and exotic as a
terra cotta soldier,
stoic and wise
as the protectors of their temple,
ageless and magnificient
as the gods they revere!
Cast your rays of life
through my humble dormitory!
May your sublime beauty
touch all those who dare to gaze upon!
