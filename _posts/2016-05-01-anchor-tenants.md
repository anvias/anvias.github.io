(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Anchor tenants occupy Wall Street,
Submarines, a splash of color
below 10,000 PSI of blue.
Anchor tenants also occupy
my house, like my dad
and the ghost of Arthur
Johnson hiding in the water-
stained asbestos tiles.
Most anchors disappear, though,
falling into the sea. Fake.
What's real is the estates
of real estate developers,
amorphous blobs tacking
Memos to stairwells.
They all live in Brooklyn.
They act through their agents
who act through their agents
anchored in the real
estate. We all pay our respects.
