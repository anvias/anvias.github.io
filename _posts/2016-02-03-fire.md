We all fear the spider-
web below this city.
Not the anxiety of symbolic comprehension
emblematic of our system,
but a viral dread
that billows of smoke
with manhole eyes,
thunder beneath bedrock,
will snake to our spaces
and shove our faces into concrete.
It's the expectation of crisis,
magnitude unknown,
towers crumbling to dust,
pedestrians like flies,
motion Brownian,
suddenly trapped in the web
they helped build, a long time ago.
