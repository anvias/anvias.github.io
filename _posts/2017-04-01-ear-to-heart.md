(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Put an ear to your heart, and tell me
what you hear when you repeat after me:
Angus MacMillen. Fordham O'Dell.
Arthur (of the sea). Turkey-Neck D.
I know you'll crow "cow" or "fowl"
but can you really understand
what the feathery beast feels
until you've broken its neck
with your own two hands?
Better to eat than be eaten,
take it from me,
a champion delicatessen critic,
part time from April to May.
