If you open up his chest and step inside,
you'll find a grassy meadow. Go on through.
Some winding trails are ancient, others new.
You choose a path and let it be your guide,
it makes no difference, for they all collide,
converging on an X that you construe
is marked as such because it hides what's true.
Before you dig he asks "may I confide?"
Your feet give out! You're sinking 'neath the flowers!
O meadow built on quicksand! What deceit!
Once through, you look upon what Earth devours:
O hell of pillars! Scaffolds of concrete!
Yet! Every man must build these ugly towers,
as darkness is where he becomes complete.
