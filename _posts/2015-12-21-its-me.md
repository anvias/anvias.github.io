(transcribed from notebook)

It's me, the amateur-grammer. My apps are cruddy. My education? I sat on a rug with velvet fibers, laptop covering crotch, antennae attuned to various chatty channels, fingers spreading oil on plastic, clacking like a duck with polio. Real programmers learn on steel, inhaling and exhaling, taught through beards with machetes and axes. All I ever used was paper.
