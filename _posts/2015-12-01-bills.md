(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

From my vantage point, the words "post no bills" are a sign of weakness. Of failed authority to undermine the waiting hordes of concert shillers, theater advocates, dance enthusiasts, and petty vandals who have nothing better to do than slather color on your drywall.
Maybe if you anticipate selling you should get some bills instead of matte evergreen.
"Post No Bills" is a blight on the urban landscape, a plague upon stimuli, a virus spread between postal addresses, pockmarking developments far afield of Long Island City. I've never seen Pink in Midtown, the only Blue is the sky.
