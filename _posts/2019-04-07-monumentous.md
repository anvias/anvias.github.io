She was carried across as a teen,
body fertile and unblemished.
She would point to the ground
and dance in her triangular hat.

As she aged, she stood firm and erect.
She would point to the heavens,
in her bowler of straw or felt,
beauty engraved upon her face.

Now she is old and crumbling,
blind and gray-haired.
She spins round and points
with a jagged finger, whispering
"Remember. Remember."
