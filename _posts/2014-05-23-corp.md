Right around sunrise his Babe Ruth alarm strikes it out of the park. He jolts upright, flexing his impressive abdominals in the morning rays. After donning a hula-hoop shirt to complement tighty-whities, he globs a blob of gel onto his already greasy mop, hair textured like a fresh long-player. Covering a yawn, he punches through the doorway and flings his keys into the air. A shine crosses his  chompers as he horseshoes the keyring onto his finger. Slamming the door behind him, he hits the driveway, hopping into a seated slide along his thunderbird's sparkling surface, legs dangling off the edge. His shades and ass drop into place right before he twists the automobile to life. The engine roars like the MGM lion as he spirits along the pavement, his tail drifting yet not quite out of control. The sun flares in the corner of his eye as the radio fuzzes to life -OUR SPONSORS, AND NOW WE'RE BACK WITH THE HITS AND MORE! Electrified and wild, hoots and hollers, strings and sex and baritone sax and the snare beats a two four and his voice cracks to falsetto as he mirrors the intensity and joy of the moment trapped on the record.
