(transcribed from notebook)

Don't you have Better Things to do
with your stay on Earth
than throw messages in bottles
onto my island?

I am not a fountain,
merely a trickle,
drink elsewhere or none will remain.
It will never taste as good
as when I flowed purely.

Some men may be dragons
for you to chase,
but I am a rodent
hiding in the bushes.
I climbed back up my tree,
acorns safe and sound,
waiting for your bottles
to get swallowed by the tide.
