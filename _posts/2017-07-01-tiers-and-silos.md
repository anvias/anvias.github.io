(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Tiers and silos, the sun in his eyes,
squinting, bitter like a fresh cup of coffee,
orange hard hats and orange juice.
Grids of cars locked on grids of concrete
settled beneath. Docks and ironworks,
steam rising, streams babbling,
plants beside plants,
bridges along ridges,
train lines and road signs
for diners and apartment rentals.
Rivers tinted by morning light,
vegetation ornamenting their storehouses,
glass bricks missing,
taken by youthful explorers on summer nights,
and placed upon the desks
to twinkle in the lamplight
beside their window, where the pine trees
shrug and a breeze cleans the air,
same smell as when they were once tucked into bed
by their father, but that was many years ago.
