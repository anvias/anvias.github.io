(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Coils of flux branded by iron,
dribbling nodules, liquid orbs
like rancid butter in the sun,
spiraling smoke, silvery solder
carrying currents, peristalsis,
tingles of pain oscillating
from quadrant to quadrant.
O trails! O Sisyphean composure!
O horizon of indeterminacy!
O mental marathon! Neverending!
The sickly sweetness of finish,
dehydrating victory, far too late,
unseemly comfort beyond the wait.
