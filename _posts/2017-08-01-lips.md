(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

The lips are gobbling up the sand.
Big, blue green lips, bubbling and boiling.
I'm shivering in the sun. Is it the flu?
Whatever it is, it feels like a spectre
sitting on my shoulder,
whispering another man's dreams to me,
reminding me... of what? The sand
tastes salty, coarse and crunchy.
It spills out all over my pinched face,
littering my shorts and Nikes.
I spit and I spit until my throat feels like sandpaper,
and then I blessedly fall asleep.
