Have you ever done whippets in a bathroom stall
with your Tinder date at a bowling alley called The Brooklyn Bowl
where middle aged men play Rock & Roll
and drink lagers upon lagers from the brewery next store?

Have you ever messaged a girl
paragraphs upon paragraphs, carefully written,
of facts about New York state highways and shipping routes
even though you didn't really like her?

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,
but you can never really tell what the person
on the other end of a leaky telephone line
is going to assume you were thinking
when you sent that hasty telegram
at 4 AM
on a Tuesday.
