(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

The pathetic fern grows green,
a carpet for this tree,
mostly significant for the lovely ironwork
separating our pathetic ferns
from concrete.
Our garbage garden is gray and green,
Nutrition Facts shuddering in the wind,
plastic blending with black paint.
It was supposed to be an oasis,
like a pool in a mirage,
as if a hundred pedestrians
pissed in the desert,
pointed to the puddle,
and called it a resevoir. Gross.
