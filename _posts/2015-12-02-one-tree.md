(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

There only exists one tree on the streets of Manhattan and it is optically projected via camera obscura onto reflective windowpanes that present a distortion, a clone, yet extend the reach of the lone tree to a few thousand blocks that otherwise would be dimly lit centers of hedonism and Human Interest. Green is the color of money except in the winter.
