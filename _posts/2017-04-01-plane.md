(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

What plane are you operating?
What plain are you on,
cockpit high above the plateaus
that me and her and most
are content to rest upon?
A rock looking at a mountain,
I guess.

And from up on high, do the strings reach,
sturdy enough for the wind,
taut enough that when you pull,
I'm lifted?
Or is it the wind who pulls the strings,
and you merely hold the cross
and peer as I wobble beneath?

Yes or no, I hope it's cozy
up there with your rat troupe
and shrubbery.
I'll be waiting down here,
should you choose to climb, or jump.
One last thing: an eastward wind
might suddenly decide to blow south,
as we're more than 2 choices, or 4.
