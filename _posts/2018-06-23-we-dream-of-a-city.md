We dream of a city that's spread across time. We walk down the main street to see what we see. There's farmland and horses then rows of brick brownstones then juttings of skyscrapers standing up tall. We stroll up and down and we peer into cellars and gaze into windows and dream of the people who once lived within. We each have our notebooks in which we draw pictures and write brief descriptions of all that we see. And as it gets later, the buildings get taller as our little dream hits the end of the street.

We're boxed in by towers obscuring the sunset; we go get some coffee and share all our notes. A heated discussion ensures over details we found as we wandered around the old town. We write on a whiteboard and scribble down patterns of wood-frames and brick-lays and what it all means, eventually deciding which ones were important and which ones were part of individual dreams. And once we've agreed on the truth of the matter, we compile it into a leather-bound tome. It's sent to the mayor who calls it his story and shares it with everyone in the world.
