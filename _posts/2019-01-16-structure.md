I'm sitting on that structure where
I once climbed out and felt such fear.
But that was when I first moved here
and now I feel unmoved. I stare
across into the windowsills
like mine. I feel no stories there.
It's almost like I have no care
left in the world. But then what fills
this head of mine? What shall I do
to pass the time? I wish I knew.
I do not see a path divine.
My heart seems buried in my chest,
its beating seems to undermine
the ground beneath the very best.
