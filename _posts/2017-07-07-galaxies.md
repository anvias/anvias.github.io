we're both trapped in a gravitational pull toward the center
of a hidden mass that lies at the heart of the universe. 
the arms of the milky way are pulling us
deeper, and our lazy attempts at escape
are met with forces stronger than before,
bringing us inward, through our fingertips, up our spinal columns, and straight into the mesolimbic pathway,
dopamine signaling to us a clear "welcome home."
