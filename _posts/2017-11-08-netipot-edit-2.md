Dreams of genies, spirit
twisting up your sinuses.
A still haze shrouds
your profane sculpture
like clouds over Venus.

And with sudden vigor,
I part the velvet shroud!
Behind it lies the ocean,
translucent and aquamarine,
whisking away coagulated
blood clots with salty breeze!

Genie of misty horizon!
O, He who disperses the clouds!
Your Profanity hath become truth!
