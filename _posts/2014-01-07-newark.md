the barren artificial plaza demonstrating man's dominion
over the moon's misty darkness encircles
teardrops of flame bursting above cast iron tubes
flickering into a curl of brief existence

another simmers unfailingly into the glaring night
a reminder of what lies hidden behind
our brilliant crystalline network of light
where the privileged laugh, live and toil
