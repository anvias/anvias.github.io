(transcribed from notebook)

A grate of linked steel or iron, attached to a chain responsible for ascent and descent. Beneath the grate, ivory spikes point downward, all the same length, vicious.

The grate ascends at a leisurely pace, and rapidly drops back to the ground, spikes embedded in Earth, no opposition. Ascent begins anew.

The only real differences between Sonic the Hedgehog and my life involve consequences.
