(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

The train conductor never gets a break.
The rivers and the sunsets roll on by,
same lovers at the station always cry.
He's seen it all before. He's half awake.
A million rides and never one mistake:
reliability's in short supply,
so he's the train dispatcher's favorite guy,
but then one misotry morning he did spake:
why must I ride this up and down
like Sisyphus upon his hill?
I'd sooner drop the boulder round,
how many riders would I kill?
No! Prognosis is a rot inside my brain!
My punishment is conducting this train!
