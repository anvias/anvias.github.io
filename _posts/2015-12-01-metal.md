(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Metal was stamped, holes were punched,
circles drilled, joints inserted,
seams split, patterns printed
onto a rectangle forged of iron.
Born in the Centralia mines,
smelted at Pittsburgh steel,
processed in Chicago
with a design from California,
then shipped by truck to New York,
placed in its position, noble,
of guarding a hole in the sidewalk,
lest a pedestrian wander close.
