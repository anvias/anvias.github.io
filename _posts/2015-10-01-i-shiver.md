(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

I shiver on a field of grass
while music plays of summers past
two girlish figures rest their heads
and use each other's bodies like their beds

The sunlight slowly starts to fade,
I climb the hill to fetch a ray.
The skyline swallows up what's left.
I tie my shoes for I am bereft.
