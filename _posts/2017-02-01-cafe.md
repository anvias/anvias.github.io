(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

We roll on over to the dirty cafe
drink shitty coffee + feel dirty all day
rumbles of garbage, stumble down the hall
hit on the lights + puke in a stall

bananas? you can only buy the peel
or how do you feel about a half-eaten meal?
cooked with bugs we found on the floor,
greens freshly picked from the lot next door.
