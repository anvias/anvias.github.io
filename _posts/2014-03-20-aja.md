They've gathered, grinning, grasping Green Mountain IPA.
They crowd round the cones: cue, crackle, then quiet.

A ride whispers and tingles, and cools pedals aswirl in pastels,
like precious Polaroids of Suburbia, rustling in the breeze.

Beneath the squawks and solos, vigorous sticks tap
nostalgia for "glory days" of electricity and cocaine.
