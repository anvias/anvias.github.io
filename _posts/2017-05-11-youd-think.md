You'd think with all the words we spilled
that maybe, thoughtless, you'd have let it fly
but once or twice. Just between you and I,
if you had said it, I'd be unfulfilled,
because I'd say it back just like you willed
and you know that I hate to tell a lie.
I'm sure you've heard it from some other guy,
but on foundations shaky you can't build
a house in this great city: it's the rule.
We untrained jesters couldn't draft the plans
we'd need to satisfy legal demands.
One cannot build a thing without a tool,
and though we two are blessed with working hands,
without a future, we both play the fool.
