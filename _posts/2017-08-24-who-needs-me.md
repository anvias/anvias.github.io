We all need each other
more urgently than the days
when we played, dined,
knew, and mingled.
The cul-de-sac was easy living.
Someone built it for us.
They cared.

It was simple to find a friend
for a game of hide-and-go-seek.
Simply ring the bell.
If your buddy was home
you'd quickly be able to tell.

But now we've left our quaint little house
and moved into the grand hotel,
and inside the infinite hallway of doors
that don't open, each room is a shell.

We sit and wait for a knock,
then we peep through the pigeonhole
and recoil. KA-CHUNK!
The deadbolt's locked.
Go back to your room
across the hall.

"We'll surely let the next one in," we think,
"it's certain to happen someday."
And amidst those vast, empty halls
there's nobody to prove us wrong,
until we peer outside
and read the words
"no vacancy."
