(transcribed from notebook)

The window looks back at my elbows, bunched against the bar. Thru the window: Starbucks Coffee. Another bar, a row of silhouettes, legs crossed, frozen, despite the sudden red and blue of a passing ambulance.

Do they sit and gaze at me? Myself mostly motionless, perched upon this stool? Or are they occupied by this pooch, skin drooping onto the concrete, passing my nest?

I can't tell reflection from reality, but the music is better in here.
