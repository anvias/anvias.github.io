(transcribed from notebook)

Now that the Beatles are on Spotify how can I ever focus on my work again?
When the Beatles came out on CD, I spent a month purifying the acoustic space inside my house. I cleaned the whole block, really juiced me up.
When the Beatles were reissued on vinyl, I mail-ordered thirty-something copies and used them as dreamcatchers.
Only George, Paul, Miles and Ringo can cure my night terrors.
