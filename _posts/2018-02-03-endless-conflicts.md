Endless conflicts rage beneath
the mortar house I've built myself.
I pray these conflicts will be brief,
for poverty and failing health

are fellows resting just beside
the bed on which my essence died.
I've locked my door and hid the key,
this room I've locked myself inside.

I've forgotten what's outside my home.
I'd once explored and gathered stones
To build a strong foundation as
a gift to future weary bones.
