The spirit of death sits up on my cuff
recanting tales into my naivest ear.
Collected from tomes of tragical stuff,
each whispered word rings shrilly with fear.
I believe in the truth of phrases I read,
as blinded as Abraham up on Moriah.
I'd kill mine own son as a devotional deed.
Such testing of faith leaves one a pariah.
O spirit! Why must you tear me in two!
My only desire's to satisfy you!
