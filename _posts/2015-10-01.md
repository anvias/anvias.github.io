(date approximate, transcribed from notebook)

Thirteen grave miles with
thirteen grave yards.
Skeletal picket fences
tended by skeletal men.
Grass grows brown as
trees grow bare,
crows replace songbirds,
squirrels disappear.
No dungeon submerged could feel so dire
as the humming expanse of overhead wire,
sky gray as the city.
