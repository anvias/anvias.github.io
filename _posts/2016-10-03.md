This minivan rear, leaving suburbia,
after dinner with an uncle
we only see once a year.
He makes us salty tomato soup,
collects train paraphernalia,
and shows us R rated movies,
but we always fall asleep
on his chair beside the jazz CDs
and penny jar, filled to the brim.
I take his Stereophile magazine
and wonder how my father felt
when he wandered these streets
and saw his favorite band,
the Doobie Brothers, at the park.
Dad loves Starbucks after dinner,
and I won't understand until I'm older.

These blue hour sidewalks
cuddle the ravine, and
panthers guard the bridge,
fifteen stories above the lake,
where nobody has bathed
for over fifteen years.
Carrying a tripod sucks,
and I get weird looks
at the sports facility
where children play disk golf
as the sun sets behind the highway.
Nobody uses this sidewalk this late.
I only photograph shadows.
